# Contributing to Carbon Vue

There's a lot to be done still, and a lot more to maintain. So any help is welcomed.

- Starting with this CONTRIBUTING.md file
- Components, new ones but also maintaining the existing ones
- Setting up a better CD/CI workflow, with automated labels for PR
- PR templates
- Unit tests

If you would like to contribute, please reach out and it will be my pleasure to share this repository.
